# BMI Calculator

## Project Description

This project is a command-line Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator written in Python. It prompts users to enter their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), calculates their BMI, and classifies it into categories based on predefined ranges.

### Features

- User-friendly command-line interface
- Validates user input for weight and height
- Calculates BMI using the standard formula
- Classifies BMI into categories:
  - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
  - Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
  - Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
  - Obesity: BMI ≥ 30

## Key Concepts

- **User Input Validation:** Ensures valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handles errors gracefully.
- **BMI Calculation:** Accurately implements the BMI formula.
- **Categorisation:** Classifies BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.5

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eadewusic/OIBSIP.git
   cd oibsip_task3
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python bmi_calculator.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `bmi_calculator.py` file is located.
3. Run the following command to start the BMI Calculator:

```bash

4. Follow the prompts to enter your weight and height.
5. The program will calculate your BMI and display the result along with the BMI category.

## Example

```plaintext
Welcome to the BMI Calculator
What is your name? Emma
Hello, Emma
